## Learning Goals

These workbooks represent my journey through various front-end development topics. My goals are to:

- Solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Gain proficiency in using front-end frameworks and libraries.
- Explore back-end development and integrate it with front-end projects.
- Continue learning and improving my coding skills through practice and new projects.

I look forward to expanding my knowledge and working on more advanced projects in the future.
